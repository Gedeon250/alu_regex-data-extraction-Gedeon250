Web Application for Regex Data Extraction
It is an easy web application which was coded without the use of any frameworks or libraries in basic HTML, CSS, and Python only. It uses Regular Expressions (Regex) to retrieve structured data from unstructured text like phone numbers, emails, and URLs.
Project Purpose

Why I built this:
To solve the ALU Regex Onboarding Hackathon challenge, develop a functional application that:
- Pulls at least five various types of data using regex
Has access to nothing but the most primitive tools (no Django, Flask, etc.)
Clean code and edge case management are demonstrated.

Features

From input text, the app extracts the following data:
Email addresses
URLs
Telephone numbers
Credit card numbers
Duration (12 and 24 hours)
Hashtags
Currency amounts
Tags in HTML
Folder organization
